                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <p>
                    Social Sports Dublin is a Dublin-based social group that meets several times weekly to play a game called ultimate Frisbee. We’re a beginner friendly group that has introduced over 200 people to the game since we started in 2020. In addition to ultimate Frisbee we also do various social activities like paintball, axe throwing, horse racing, pizza and beer nights at local pubs, volunteer, and plenty of other fun things. Our membership consists of both men and women ranging from ages 20-40, representing over a dozen countries from around the world. You might also know us from our competitive ultimate Frisbee team, Sundrive Social Ultimate. This team plays in tournaments hosted across Ireland, which is a fun way to stay connected to other Frisbee clubs across the country. If you’re looking for a great group of people that are active and enjoy trying new things, we’d love to meet you!
                    </p>

                    <h3>Social Aspects</h3>
                    <p>
                    In addition to both the casual and competitive side of Ultimate Frisbee in the club, the easing
                    of Covid restrictions throughout 2021 also saw a rise in the number of social events we were
                    able to attend. From a visit to the beach in scorching hot weather to a hike up a mountain in
                    freezing cold wind and rain, going to The Book of Mormon, going paintballing, watching
                    frisbee on the big screen in the Back Page, and regular nights out, the past year has been
                    very eventful, despite the constant fear of another lockdown early on. We’re now looking
                    forward to an even better year ahead!
                    </p>

                    <h3>About Ultimate Frisbee</h3>
                    <p>
                    Ultimate is a non-contact, self-refereed team sport played with a flying disc frisbee. The aim of the game: Two teams of seven players compete on a playing field about the same length as a football field, but narrower. At each end of the playing field there is an end zone. Each team defends one end zone. They score a goal if one of their players catches the disc in the opposite end zone. The player with the disc is called the thrower. The thrower may not run with the disc.  Instead they move the disc by passing to team-mates in any direction. The defensive team gets possession of the disc if an offensive team’s throw is not caught by a player of the same team. Then the defensive team becomes the offensive team and can try to score in the opposite end zone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Spirit of the Game: Ultimate relies upon a Spirit of the Game that places the responsibility for fair play on every player. There are no referees; the players are solely responsible for following and enforcing the rules, even at World Championship. Competitive play is encouraged, but never at the expense of respect between players, adherence to the rules, and the basic joy of play.
                    </p>
